## About
famille challessin is the website reserved for my family, which mainly allows me to create wishlists. 
Before that, my family used [mesenvies.fr](https://www.mesenvies.fr) and I wanted to create a platform to unify our lists and share them more easily.

## Roadmap
### v1
- [x] Add login, logout and password reset
- [x] Home page with filters
- [x] Wishlist creation

### v2
Christmas being near, I rushed and there's a lot of stuff for v2 lol :
- [ ] Improve code quality (mainly by creating services)
- [ ] Improve product scrapper
- [ ] Enable SSR
- [ ] Enable user registration
- [ ] Make an account page
- [ ] Make an admin zone
- [ ] Add Toast for wishlist creation
- [ ] Use Tuyau library for links
- [ ] Use Textarea for description fields

### v3
- [ ] Move the design system to an independent package using park-ui and pandacsss

## Credits
I'd like to credit [Romain Lanz](https://github.com/romainlanz) and his magnificent design system, which I used on this site, as well as [Julien R](https://github.com/Julien-R44) and the [adonisjs packages website](https://github.com/adonisjs-community/adonis-packages), which I drew a lot of inspiration from.  
Also, s/o to ma boi [Hugo Mourlevat](https://hugo.mourlev.at/), king of the design system, for hosting this site because I'm too poor to do it myself lmao.
